        <div class="about-info">
            <p>Hi! I'm Sakshi, a second-year Computer Engineering student passionate about exploring the intersection of technology, education and creativity. I've actively contributed to AI-driven educational solutions, particularly in developing training datasets for conflict resolution models that have impacted over 150 student interactions.</p>
            
            <p>My technical journey includes hands-on experience with web development (fontend), Generative AI and Cloud fundamentals. I also have a creative side that draws me to art, which I feel complements my technical skills nicely. This blend of technical and artistic interests helps me approach problems from different angles.</p>
            
            <p>What drives me is the potential of technology to solve real-world problems. This led me to participate in field research for a project at municipal schools, gathering insights for AI applications in education. I enjoy collaborative work, having been part of a 4-member team integrating Universal Human Values principles into AI solutions.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding or working on engineering projects, you'll find me reading about philosophy and spirituality or diving into different languages – both human and programming ones! I believe that understanding various languages and subjects opens up new ways of thinking and problem-solving. As a student, I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies. I'm excited to grow in this field and see where this journey takes me!</p>
